    <h1>Cooking</h1>
    <h2>One Pot Sausage And Sun Dried Tomato Pasta (instructions)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add the olive oil and sausage to the skillet and cook over medium heat
        until browned. If using links, cook them until browned on the outside
        and firm enough to slice, then slice into medallions, return to the
        skillet, and brown on both sides. Transfer the cooked sausage to a clean
        bowl and drain off all but about 1 Tbsp fat from the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic and frozen broccoli florets to the skillet. Saut√©
        over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, or just until the broccoli is bright
        green and no longer frozen. Transfer the broccoli florets to the bowl
        with the sausage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken broth to the skillet and stir or whisk to dissolve the
        browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Slice the sun dried tomatoes
        into strips and add them to the broth with the pasta and a pinch of red
        pepper flakes. Stir, place a lid on top, and turn the heat up to medium
        high. When the broth begins to boil, give the skillet a quick stir,
        replace the lid, and turn the heat down to low or just above low so that
        the broth maintains a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer the pasta and sun dried tomatoes for about 7 minutes, stirring
        every couple of minutes, or until the pasta is tender and most of the
        liquid is absorbed. If the pasta becomes tender before all the broth has
        been absorbed, simply let it simmer for the last couple of minutes
        without the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pasta is tender and only a small amount of thickened liquid
        remains in the bottom of the skillet, add the cooked sausage and
        broccoli back to the pasta. Stir to combine and sprinkle the grated
        Parmesan over top. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
